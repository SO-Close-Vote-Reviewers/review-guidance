> ###Late Answers and First Posts
> The Late Answers queue contains answers which were posted much later than the question (and thus don't get as much attention, the purpose of this queue is to give them attention). The First Posts queue contains the first few posts asked by new users (who will probably need help learning to use the site).
>
> In these queues, you can edit the post, flag it, upvote or downvote it, add a comment, or upvote a previously existing comment. When you take one of these actions, the I'm Done button becomes enabled, allowing you to complete review. If you feel that the post is fine as it is, but you don't want to vote on it (you're not that impressed with it, etc), then you can always click the No Action Needed button. If you're unsure about the post, please use the Skip button.

> You gain access to these queues [at the 500 reputation mark](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/access-review-queues).
>
> Note: These two queues do not exist on Meta sites (thus the reputation requirement is higher on MSO).

> ##Guidelines for reviewing Late Answers
> 
> Answers in the Late Answers review queue are also First Posts or very nearly so, since they are posted by [new users](http://stackoverflow.com/privileges/new-user), so apply all the steps for [reviewing First Posts](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/180030/147247) here.
> 
> ### Basic workflow
> 
> 1. Many Late Answers are spam or self promotion. A new user searches for a word or phrase and adds the answer "My product does that - check it out at `link`!" to an old answer, or dozens of them. Check the answer against the [guidelines for self promotion](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/94027/147247). If it meets them, add a comment mentioning this, to reduce the chance of other reviewers marking it spam. If it does not, add a comment linking to them and encouraging an edit. Consider keeping the question open in a tab so you can return and flag as spam in an hour or two.
> 
> 2. It's important to check if the answer is really relevant to the question. If you don't know the topic well enough to assess this, avoid actions beyond simple editing for format.
> 
> 3. If you flag, you can leave one of several "canned" comments or your own. Unless there is an existing comment that covers the situation, do add one - the user needs to learn what they did wrong in this case.
> 
> ### Common reasons to *Flag* / *Close*
> 
>  - Spam
>  - Well-intentioned "not an answer" from someone who needs to be educated about our site
